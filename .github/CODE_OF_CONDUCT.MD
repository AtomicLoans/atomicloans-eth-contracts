## Atomic Loans Core Team Promise

We promise all features, additions, and changes we make protocol to empower users to be in complete absolute control over their own actions and exchanges. We commit to having an open, responsive, professional, thoughtful, and friendly community that challenges the status quo and provides builders with all the tools they need to build powerful applications.

## Conduct Standards

  * Welcoming, open, and inclusive.
  * Showing empathy.
  * Respectful of privacy and differing opinions.
  * Thoughtful and intelligent.

## Community Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope & Enforcement
